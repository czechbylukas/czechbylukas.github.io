    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This website, <strong>HáCZech</strong> (www.hackczech.com), respects your privacy. This page explains how I collect, use, and protect your information in compliance with GDPR and Google’s 2026 requirements.</p>

    <h2>1. Google Analytics & Consent Mode</h2>
    <p>I use <strong>Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</strong> to understand how students use my Czech lessons. To protect your privacy in the EEA, I have implemented <strong>Google Consent Mode v2</strong>.</p>



<ul>
      <li><strong>Default State:</strong> All non-essential cookies are disabled by default until you provide explicit consent.</li>
      <li><strong>If you "Accept":</strong> I use cookies to analyze site traffic, remember your preferences, and provide personalized content.</li>
      <li><strong>If you "Reject":</strong> No cookies are stored on your device for analytics or advertising. I only receive "advanced implementation pings"—anonymous signals that help us count visits without identifying you.</li>
    </ul>




    <h2>2. Information I Collect</h2>
   <p><strong>Account & Login Data:</strong> If you create an account, I collect your login credentials (NOT the password) and track your progress. This data is used to generate personalized learning reports and improve your study experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Newsletter:</strong> If you subscribe, I collect your name (optional) and email address to send you language learning updates and news.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> I collect information on how you interact with my lessons (e.g., time spent, pages visited) to optimize our curriculum.</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>This site uses cookies to improve your experience. You can manage your consent through the banner that appears on your first visit. You can also withdraw consent at any time by clearing your browser cookies. For more details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" target="_blank">Google’s Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>I use the following trusted services:</p>



<ul>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To analyze website traffic. We use IP anonymization to ensure your full IP address is never stored.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> I use Firebase for user authentication and database management. Your account details (email and login activity) are stored on Google’s secure cloud infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Database:</strong> Your newsletter and preferences are stored securely for the sole purpose of providing our services.</li>
    </ul>




    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR, you have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. You can unsubscribe from emails at any time using the link in the footer or by contacting me directly.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact:</p>
